# ðŸ©º Heart Disease Prediction API  
*A Machine Learning + FastAPI + Docker project*

---

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project is a **FastAPI-based REST API** that predicts whether a person is likely to have **heart disease**, using a **Logistic Regression model** trained on the public **Heart Disease Dataset** from Kaggle.  

The API exposes clean, documented endpoints for health check, model info, and prediction â€” and can be easily deployed on any cloud using **Docker** (e.g., Render, Railway, AWS, etc.).
